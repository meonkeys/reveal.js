## No, it will not hurt the chicken

By [Adam Monsen](http://adammonsen.com), VP Engineering at [C-SATS, Inc.](https://csats.com)



This is the story of four chickens

Who meet one raccoon


<!-- .element: data-background-image="./img/800px-Waschb√§r4.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->


And quickly become a flock of one.


This is the story of...


## _The Chicken Who Lived_

## Meet Louise

Our stealthy Welsummer


Louise wants to live and wants a new flock.

First she needs a safer home.

# Suspicious!



# Chicken primer


1. Never get wet
1. Never expose to sunlight
1. Never feed after midnight

SpeakerNote: Sorry, wrong primer (see Gremlins - 1984 movie)



# Real chicken primer

SpeakerNote: They also eat bugs and rocks.


1. Food ‚Üí Chicken ‚Üí Egg
1. Not smart
1. Must be locked in at night

Chickens get in the coop before dusk.

They are pros at this.


You need to lock it up at night


And open it in the morning

SpeakerNote: so they can free range and stuff


(and keep them safe during the day)

SpeakerNote: nocturnal predators may also hunt during the day, and there are other daytime predators too



So, let's build some stuff!


# TL;DR üêî

1. Plan project
1. Buy parts
1. Practice mini-projects
1. Prototype
1. Install
1. Celebrate
