## Note to self

This is the story of four chickens


<!-- .element: data-background-image="./img/four-chx.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->


Who meet one hungry little furball


<!-- .element: data-background-image="./img/800px-Waschb√§r4.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->


And quickly become a flock of one.


This is the story of...


## _The Chicken Who Lived_

## Meet Louise

Our stealthy Welsummer


Louise wants to live and wants a new flock.

First she needs a safer home.

One with an automatic door!

Louise likes the new coop but when it comes to the door she is...


<!-- .element: data-background-image="./img/suspicious.jpg" -->

# Suspicious!


She'll get over it.


Let's talk about chickens.



# Chicken primer


1. Never get wet
1. Never expose to sunlight
1. Never feed after midnight

SpeakerNote: Sorry, wrong primer (see Gremlins - 1984 movie)



# Real chicken primer

SpeakerNote: They also eat bugs and rocks.


1. Food ‚Üí Chicken ‚Üí Egg
1. Chicken not smart
1. Must be locked in at night



# Must be locked in at night

Chickens get in the coop before dusk.

They are pros at this.


All you need to do is lock up the coop at night


_Every night_


And open it in the morning

SpeakerNote: so they can free range and stuff


_Every morning_


_even in the summer when that sun comes up really early and the chickens really really wanna get out at the buttcrack of dawn_


Yeah no. Let's automate it!


# TL;DR üêî

1. Plan project
1. Buy parts
1. Practice mini-projects
1. Prototype
1. Install
1. Celebrate

## More ideas

* [Use Raspian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
    * codename: "stretch" (with desktop)
* Try the camera: do a time-lapse video
* Try a project from a Starter Kit (e.g. Adeept)

SpeakerNote: Add mouse + keyboard + monitor for a perfect kid desktop!


* Ask for help!
* Try combining sensors / lights / camera
* Use lots of emoji üêî üö¶ üòì ‚è∞ üèÅ üê£ üåá üì° üì∑ üöß



## Lessons learned

* If the Raspberry Pi won't boot, unplug all peripherals and try again. If USB ports are full, peripherals may draw too much power.
* Get help, ask around. Call friends. Pair up. Find a local maker space.
* I'm incredibly lucky to have a brilliant, patient partner who is great at woodwork and code review.

(continued)


* Use a 32GB flash card. I bricked a 64GB card.
* Easy: camera. Plug & play!
* Hard: door actuator: spindle, dealing with drag/resistance. Tight tolerance.
    * Temperature and humidity affect (wooden) door operation.
* Hard: 12V DC motor. L9110 controller is tricky to wire. Software is complex. Wasted time on [PWM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation).

(continued)


* Easy: magnetic (hall effect) sensor.
* Hard: Adeept Python photoresistor code didn't work, but C code did.
* Easy: posting messages to IRC or Slack.
* Early mistake: motion alerts for all chicken movement.
* [Adeept source is on GitHub](https://github.com/adeept/)
* Nocturnal predators may also hunt during the day, and there are other daytime predators too.
